From the image above we can see the main difference is the setting will determine the total fares amount over each month. Urban settings are much more profitable, Suburn second and the Rural settings are last. 
Overall there is not much variation in the total fare over time except for the Urban and Suburban have a slight increase from the beginning of the graph forwards. 

3.Summary
-*Urban settings are overall more profittable but average fare per driver is $16 which means more employees per dollar
-*Rural settings are much less overall profittable but the average fare per driver is significantly higher
-*All settings are fairly stable month to month with the total fares
